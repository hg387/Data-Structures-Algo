Programming Assignment 2, CS260

Implementation of various trees data structures such as huffman, traversal and other tree techniques.

To run any of the program, just use the makefile and following command

make levelorder
OR
make pointerqueue

All the results would be displayed.
NOTE: Also in programs preoder and postorder, I have encountered a problem of 
making make file that would take stdin as whenever we enter *, shell act differently
. I have found no way to escape this character so i have included the expression used 
in make file.
